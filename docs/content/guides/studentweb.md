## Phase II - Start Answering Questions

When all of the students have created an acceptable number of questions, the Teacher will move to the "Start Answering Questions" phase.  The Stuedent will be presented with a set of one or more questions to answer.  The questions are in the form of Multiple Choice, so the format will be familiar to many students.
